**Apple's Notes App**

Author: Wang Yu

**Pros:**

* Apple's built-in Notes App is nothing different from a paper notebook except that it is electronic which makes it capable of storing more than enough notes and deleting notes that are no longer needed
* Due to its sustainability, Notes is very suitable for traditional notes takers who are not comfortable with being restricted by commands and forms
* With the Notes App on iCloud.com, users can easily get to see their notes on different platforms if Internet connection is available

**Cons:**

* Notes is only available for the Apple OS platform. As our target are MS users, Notes is not an option for them
* Notes cannot recognize task's data and group them together
* All the updating need to be done by directly manipulating the text, which is quite a bother
* If the user mistakenly edited something wrongly, there is no turning back for them since there is no undo function

### 2.6. Showing done tasks: `show`

Shows tasks that are done or undone.<br>
Format: `show done/undone`

> * This command is case insensitive. e.g `DONE` works the same as `done`
> * Only the status is searched.
> * Only full words will be matched e.g `do` will not match `done`

Examples:

* `show done`<br>
  Returns tasks that are done
* `show undone`<br>
  Returns tasks that are undone

### 2.13. Finish a task : `finish`

Mark an existing task as "done" in the todo list.<br>
Format: `finish INDEX`

Alternative commands: "done", "complete"

> Marks the task as "done" at the specified `INDEX`. <br>
> The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
> The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

* `list`<br>
  `finish 2`<br>
  Marks the 2nd task as "done" in the todo list.
* `find do`<br>
  `done 1`<br>
  Marks the 1st task as "done" in the results of the `find` command.
